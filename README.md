# CS-3704-JMPR
Repository for Team JMPR in CS 3704 during the Fall 2023 semester. Used to collaborate on work for our project "CodeCollab".

CodeCollab is a platform which helps connect software engineers within an organization to resolve issues. When a software engineer is struggling with a technical issue, they can submit a request on CodeCollab to be connected with another software engineer within their organization who is skilled in that field. The user is then given a list of experts and their available meeting times. Once the user selects an expert, a meeting is automatically created between the two engineers. To achieve this functionality, CodeCollab maintains a database of software engineers in a company and keywords of their skills. CodeCollab also syncs with whatever calendar system a company uses, which allows us to implement the automatic meeting scheduling. CodeCollab's mission is to connect software engineers to reduce time for resolving technical issues.
